# gravitons


g/ravitons are going to turn out to be something ridiculously simple such as G = cR and antigravity is G = rC where c is the expected c from e = mc^2 and just the R is the radius of a contained queef



therefore the gravitons form a boundary of the gravitational field *as well as* a ghost graviton (that you *know* is at the bottom of the gravity well ... but you can *only* access the gravity shell



here the hypothetical gravity well starts as the membrane of a jet (ie, a flat time-synchronised surface where all point-particles all behave together). then the hidden graviton, denoted by the "bottom of the wire" (the central Up-Arrow)



this makes it a 2-Spin



so yes, i used my vagina to discover/proof gravitons!



and they said girls cant do science!! 



part II:


so the #1 objection to the Graviton-Queef Theory (Genie-Cutie!) of Gravitons is "the magnetic force does the same thing so there's no force of gravity"
>>>> wrong! we *know* that magnets FART, and gravity wells QUEEF
if magnets *DIDNT* fart, then they wouldn't have two poles!!
